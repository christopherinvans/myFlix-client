# myFlix-client
 
MyFlix is a movie app containing a few of my favorite films. Users are able to create an account, browse the movie selection, and learn details about each movie such as a description, the movie's genre, and the director. Users can also create a list of their favorite movies, and update their profile information. The client-side of the app displays several interface views that handle data through the REST API endpoints.

The back-end includes authentication and authorization, and was built using JWToken, CORS, & Passport.

This project utilizes the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, & Node.js.

Other tools used include: Bootstrap, Redux, Parcel, Heroku, Javascript, HTML, & CSS.
